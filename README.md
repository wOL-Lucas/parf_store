# parf_store
First project with Java + Springboot.

## Solving a Administration problem.
In a scenario where the administration of a cosmetics store lacks full control over every income, outcome, and even which products are their best sellers, or the ones that get stuck in the stock, our system comes in just in time to save your business.

### Tecnologies used in the process.
We are relying on the well-maintained and famous Java framework, Spring Boot. Additionally, we are implementing the Sicoob APIs to have more control over our income, outcome, and finances.
